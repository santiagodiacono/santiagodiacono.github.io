    <h2>BDA 594</h2>
<p>
    The data set selected was the world bank data  , 
    this data is extremely important in understanding developing countries and the challenges they face. 
    It provides an overview of the poverty percentage in developing countries and topics associated with it 
    like for example , access to electricity and water, incomes per capita, access to food, access to housing 
    etc. It can be applied also for resources to generate more innovative and effective solutions for this type 
    of problems. The data is shown as charts , frequencies tables and pie charts which are pretty easy to
     understand and to work with for fast and efficient solutions.

    I selected a course in machine learning by Haul Daume lll. I think this book is very interesting 
    because it explains to beginners like me how to use algorithms that learn from data and experience 
    sometimes I donâ€™t know how to make sense of the data that I have so this book will help create codes 
    and algorithms that will help me in any desired area where I found a topic of interest.
